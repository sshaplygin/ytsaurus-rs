# Changelog

## Unreleased

### The worker is uploaded once, not once per launch

- **Added** `Client::upload_worker_cached`, `Client::file_from_cache`,
  `Client::put_file_to_cache` and `Client::with_file_cache`. The cluster keeps a
  file cache keyed by MD5; an unchanged binary is now found there instead of
  being re-sent, which is the slowest part of a dev loop that changes only the
  spec.
- **Added** `with_local_file_named` to all three spec builders. A cached node is
  named after its hash, so `./my_job` would find nothing to run without a
  `file_name` attribute on the path. `file_paths` entries are YSON values now
  rather than plain strings, which is what makes such attributes expressible.
- **Added** a dependency on `md5` (0.8), chosen for having no dependencies of
  its own: this crate is linked into worker binaries that cross-compile to musl
  with nothing but the Rust toolchain.

The cache defaults to `//tmp/yt_wrapper/file_storage/new_cache`, the path the
Python wrapper uses, so an installation that already expires entries there
expires ours too.

Two things the cluster settled, both now handled: `get_file_from_cache` and
`put_file_to_cache` answer with a **bare string** rather than the usual
`{path=…}` envelope, and a cache miss is an **empty string**, not an error or an
entity.

Verified on the local cluster with `cargo run -p ytsaurus-client --example
cached_upload`: first call uploads (166 ms), second is a hit (32 ms) on the same
path, and the cached binary runs as a job — so both the `executable` attribute
and the sandbox name survive the trip through the cache.

### A transient failure no longer kills the run

A shared cluster produces failures that pass on their own — a restarting proxy,
a scheduler that has lost the master. One of those used to end the run. Light
commands are now repeated, following the
[documented rules](https://ytsaurus.tech/docs/en/api/commands#retry).

- **Added** `RetryPolicy` and `Client::with_retries`. Five attempts by default,
  with a delay that doubles from one second to ten. `RetryPolicy::none()` turns
  it off.
- **Added** `MutationId` and `Client::start_operation_with`. Every mutating
  command the client sends now carries a `mutation_id`, so a repeated request is
  deduplicated by the cluster rather than applied twice — without it, a 503 on
  the way *back* from a successful `start_operation` would leave the retry
  starting a second operation over the same tables.
- **Heavy commands are still sent once**, whatever the policy says: the
  documentation is explicit that they cannot be retried, and a transaction is
  the way to make an upload atomic.
- Retriable failures are transport errors, HTTP 429/500/502/503/504, and
  YTsaurus codes 3, 100, 105, 108, 904 and 2100 — the same set the Python
  client retries on. A retriable code is looked for throughout the error
  document, because the outer error is often a `Request retries failed` wrapper
  with the real reason nested inside. Codes that mean the request was wrong
  (500 resolve, 501 already exists) are never retried.

**A replay must admit to being one.** The cluster refuses a repeated
`mutation_id` sent without the `retry` flag — `Duplicate request is not marked
as "retry"` — rather than deduplicating it. So the flag travels with the ID:
`MutationId::as_retry()` marks a send as a replay, which is what a
crash-and-restart needs when it reuses a persisted ID.

Verified on the local cluster with `cargo run -p ytsaurus-client --example
idempotent`: the same ID twice returns one operation, a fresh ID starts a
second. The retry classification is unit-tested, including on the exact error
document a local cluster produced when its scheduler could not reach the master.

### Reduce and sort as operations of their own

- **Added** `ReduceSpec` / `Client::start_reduce` and `SortSpec` /
  `Client::start_sort`. Reduce over an already-sorted table is one of the most
  common operation shapes, and reaching for map-reduce instead pays for a
  shuffle that has already happened. Sort is what produces the sorted table, and
  it can then be reduced again and again.

- A reduce's `key_switch` goes under **`job_io`**, not `reduce_job_io`. That is
  the map-reduce trap in the other direction — one job type, one I/O section —
  and the wrong spelling is accepted and silently ignored, leaving the reducer
  to fold every key into one group. Both spellings are now pinned by tests.

- `sort_by` is only sent when asked for: the cluster defaults it to `reduce_by`,
  and stating it turns on a sortedness check the caller did not request.

- `SortSpec` renders **`output_table_path`** — singular, and a string rather
  than a list. Sort writes exactly one table however many it reads, and the
  plural spelling every other operation uses is rejected.

Verified on the local cluster with `cargo run -p ytsaurus-client --example
sort_reduce`: seven unsorted rows sorted (`@sorted_by` becomes `[word]`), then
reduced to four correct per-word totals. Four rows rather than one is itself the
proof that `key_switch` reached the reducer.

### The binary can upload itself

- **Added** `Client::upload_current_exe`, which uploads the running executable.
  Together with
  [`ytsaurus_job::is_inside_job`](../ytsaurus-job/CHANGELOG.md) this is the
  one-binary pattern: the same program launches the operation and runs as its
  job, so what the cluster runs is what you just built.

- **Added** `ClientError::NotAWorker`. The running executable is often not
  something a node can exec — Mach-O on macOS, dynamically linked on a
  developer's Linux — and both fail on the node minutes later with an error that
  names no cause. `upload_current_exe` reads the ELF header first (Linux,
  x86-64, no interpreter) and refuses with an error that says what to build
  instead. `upload_worker` is unchanged and stays permissive: a job command can
  legitimately be a shell script.

- **Added** the `tls` feature, on by default. Turning it off drops `rustls`,
  which drags in `ring`, which needs a C toolchain to reach musl — and a binary
  that is both launcher and job has to reach musl. With it off, an `https://`
  proxy fails with an error that names the feature rather than a confusing
  connection error. Defaults are unchanged for existing users.

  This is what lets `scripts/build-worker.sh` keep its promise of needing
  nothing but the Rust toolchain, verified by cross-compiling a worker that
  contains the whole client to static musl on macOS.

Verified end to end on the local cluster from both sides: the launcher refusing
a Mach-O binary, and the musl build of the same source uploading *itself* from
inside a Linux container and being run as the job.

### Failed operations explain themselves

`wait_for_operation` now reports *why* an operation failed. On a terminal
`failed` or `aborted` it asks the cluster which jobs failed and what each wrote
to stderr, and puts both in the error. Before this, a failed operation gave you
a state string and a trip to the web UI.

- **Added** `Client::list_jobs` and `Client::get_job_stderr`, plus the `JobInfo`
  and `JobFailure` types they return.
- **Added** `Client::with_job_diagnostics`, to turn the report off. The
  YTsaurus documentation asks that `list_jobs` not be used without an
  administrator's approval; this is the way to respect that.
- **Changed** the operation error is now the flattened message
  (`Failed jobs limit exceeded: Process terminated by signal 6`) rather than a
  truncated raw document, falling back to the raw document if the shape moves.
- **Breaking** `ClientError::OperationFailed` gained a `jobs` field. Code that
  matches the variant by name is unaffected; code that destructures every field
  needs `..`.

Collecting the report is best-effort throughout: it runs while an error is being
built, and a diagnostic that replaces the failure it was explaining would be
worse than no diagnostic.

Verified on the local cluster with the new `boom` worker, which panics on its
first row, driven by `cargo run -p ytsaurus-client --example diagnose`. The
`list_jobs` response it produced is kept as a test fixture in
`tests/fixtures/list_jobs_failed.yson`.

Two things that capture taught us, both now pinned by tests:

- `stderr_size` is a hint, not a length — the cluster reported `1` for a job
  whose stderr was several hundred bytes, so the client asks for stderr whatever
  the field says.
- The useful part of a job error is the innermost one. `User job failed` is a
  category; `Process terminated by signal 6` — a Rust panic under
  `panic = "abort"` — is the answer.

## 0.2.0

First release of this crate. Version tracks the workspace.

A thin HTTP API v4 client: enough to run a Rust worker with no Python
installation. Covers Cypress (`create`, `remove`, `exists`, `get`, `row_count`),
data (`upload_worker`, `write_file`, `write_table`, `read_table`,
`set_attribute`) and operations (`start_map`, `start_map_reduce`,
`start_operation`, `operation_state`, `wait_for_operation`), with `MapSpec` and
`MapReduceSpec` builders.

Verified against a local cluster with nothing Python on `PATH`.

Two limits are documented rather than hidden: heavy commands are not routed via
`/hosts`, and `ureq` 3.3 exposes no trailers, so a failure the proxy reports
mid-stream cannot be seen. `read_table` compensates by rejecting a response that
is not a complete YSON list fragment.
