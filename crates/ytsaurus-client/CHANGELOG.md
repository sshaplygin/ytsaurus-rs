# Changelog

## 0.2.0

First release of this crate. Version tracks the workspace.

A thin HTTP API v4 client: enough to run a Rust worker with no Python
installation. Covers Cypress (`create`, `remove`, `exists`, `get`, `row_count`),
data (`upload_worker`, `write_file`, `write_table`, `read_table`,
`set_attribute`) and operations (`start_map`, `start_map_reduce`,
`start_operation`, `operation_state`, `wait_for_operation`), with `MapSpec` and
`MapReduceSpec` builders.

Verified against a local cluster with nothing Python on `PATH`.

Two limits are documented rather than hidden: heavy commands are not routed via
`/hosts`, and `ureq` 3.3 exposes no trailers, so a failure the proxy reports
mid-stream cannot be seen. `read_table` compensates by rejecting a response that
is not a complete YSON list fragment.
